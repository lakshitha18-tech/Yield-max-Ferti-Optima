🌾Yield Max Ferti Optima:- 
                     Yield Max Ferti Optima is a smart, machine learning-powered fertilizer recommendation system designed to promote sustainable agriculture in India. The system helps farmers make informed decisions by recommending the most suitable fertilizers based on various agricultural parameters like soil health, crop type, and current weather conditions.

🚀 Objective:-
The project aims to maximize crop yield while ensuring optimal use of fertilizers, preventing soil degradation, and promoting eco-friendly farming practices.

🧠 How It Works?
User Inputs:
Soil nutrients (N, P, K values)
Crop type
pH level
Moisture level
Weather data (temperature, humidity, rainfall)
Data Processing & Machine Learning:
Uses pre-trained models to classify and recommend fertilizers

Analyzes soil deficiencies and environmental conditions

Matches with best-suited fertilizers for that condition

Output:

Fertilizer recommendation (e.g., Urea, DAP, 10-26-26, etc.)

Tips and usage guidelines

Weather-based suggestions

🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
